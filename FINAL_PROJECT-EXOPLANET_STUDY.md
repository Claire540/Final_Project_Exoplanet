FINAL PROJECT : EXOLPLANET/ STUDY OF EXOPLANET

Exoplanets refer to planets that are not in our solar system but in other planetary systems.


Questions for the study Exoplanets:

1. How many planets, on average, are there in a planetary system with one star? Two stars? Three stars?

2. How does the mass of a planet vary based on its distance from its star?

3. What is the orbital duration of a planet based on its eccentricity?

4. Is there a correlation between the brightness of a star and the number of planets in a planetary system? 

5. What is the mass of a planet based on the duration of its orbit?

6. On what date will we be able to detect planets with Earth-like mass?
