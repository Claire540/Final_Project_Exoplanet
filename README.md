FINAL PROJECT : EXOLPLANET/ STUDY OF EXOPLANET

Exoplanets refer to planets that are not in our solar system but in other planetary systems.

Exoplanet :
Any planet located outside our solar system

1995 : thanks to new technology, the first exoplanets were discovered.

From 1995 to 2023, thousands of exoplanets have been identified and cataloged (more than 6.000 confirmed, 15.000 non-confirmed).

Two space telescopes have been launched, as tool for the study of exoplanets (Hubble in 1990, James Webb in 2021).

Like any other planet, an exoplanet orbits around a star.



Questions for the study Exoplanets:

1. How many planets, on average, are there in a planetary system with one star? Two stars? Three stars?
2. Has the distance of planets (distance relative to us) increased from 1995 to nowadays? 
3. How does the mass of a planet vary based on its distance from its star? 
4. What is the orbital duration of a planet based on its eccentricity? 
5. What is the mass of a planet based on the duration of its orbit?
6. What is the duration of a planet's orbit around its star ?



Three Regression models :
